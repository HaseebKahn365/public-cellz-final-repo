1. Repo Name:
SRT Simulator (Shortest Remaining Time Simulator) README.md:1

2. GitHub Link:
https://github.com/HaseebKahn365/srt_simulato README.md:186-188

3. Timeline & Commitment:
December 2023 (Based on commit dates from December 2, 2023 to December 5, 2023) main.dart:1

4. Project Overview:
The SRT Simulator is a Flutter application that demonstrates the Shortest Remaining Time scheduling algorithm, a preemptive version of the Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithm used in operating systems. The app allows users to create processes with specific burst times, observe process scheduling in real-time, and understand how the SRT algorithm prioritizes processes based on their remaining execution time.

The target audience is process analysts, computer science students, and educators who want to visualize and understand operating system scheduling algorithms.

The core goal is to provide an interactive visualization tool that makes abstract operating system concepts more tangible and easier to understand. README.md:1-5

5. Core Functionality:
Screens/pages and flow:
The app has a single main screen with multiple UI components:

Processor visualization area (shows currently executing process)
Ready queue display (shows waiting processes)
Temporary processes area (shows newly created processes)
Process creation interface main.dart:289-290
Business logic layers:
The core business logic revolves around:

Process class that represents schedulable units of work
SRT algorithm implementation in the adjustPositions() method
CPU cycle simulation through the runCycle() method README.md:41-48
Communication between modules:
The app uses a simple architecture where:

The Process class encapsulates process data and behavior
The main stateful widget manages lists of processes and system state
Timer-based simulation drives the scheduling algorithm README.md:9
Real-time behavior:
The app simulates real-time process scheduling using:

A timer that triggers CPU cycles every second
Visual feedback showing process execution and preemption
System clock that tracks simulation time main.dart:145-163
User data handling:
The app doesn't persist user data. All process data is stored in memory during the simulation:

activeProcesses list contains processes in the scheduler
tempCreated list holds newly created processes
Process state is updated in real-time during simulation README.md:24-26
Error, state, navigation, and animations management:
State is managed using Flutter's setState() mechanism
Errors in the CPU cycle are caught and logged
Navigation is minimal (single screen with an about page)
Animations are implemented through UI updates driven by the timer main.dart:147-161
6. Key Features:
Interactive Process Creation
Users create processes by holding the "Create Process" floating action button, with the burst time determined by the duration of the press. This provides an intuitive way to create processes with different execution times. main.dart:417-447

Real-time SRT Scheduling Visualization
The app visually demonstrates how the SRT algorithm works by showing process preemption and execution in real-time, with processes sorted by remaining burst time. README.md:41-48

Process Queue Management
Users can create multiple processes and add them to the scheduler in batches, allowing for experimentation with different process arrival patterns. main.dart:307-315

Visual Process Differentiation
Each process is assigned a random color for easy visual identification throughout its lifecycle in the system. main.dart:437-444

7. Flutter/Dart Skills Demonstrated:
State Management
The app uses Flutter's built-in setState() mechanism for state management, updating the UI in response to:

Timer-driven CPU cycles
User interactions (process creation, adding processes to the scheduler)
Algorithm execution (process sorting, completion) main.dart:148-158
Async programming & Future/Stream use
The app demonstrates async programming through:

Timer-based simulation of CPU cycles
Periodic execution of the scheduling algorithm
Handling long-press gestures for process creation main.dart:421-426
Custom Widgets
The app implements several custom widgets:

ActiveProcesses widget for displaying the ready queue
Processor widget for visualizing the CPU
Process cards with dynamic coloring and information display main.dart:501-586
Gesture Recognition
The app uses gesture detection for process creation, with a long-press gesture controlling the burst time of new processes. main.dart:417-427

8. Architecture & Design Decisions:
Architecture Pattern
The app uses a simple monolithic architecture with a single stateful widget managing the entire application state. This approach is appropriate for the app's educational purpose and limited scope. README.md:9

Folder Structure
The project has a minimal folder structure with:

Main application code in lib/main.dart
About page in lib/about_me.dart
Process class in lib/classes_and_vars/process.dart main.dart:7
Modularity
The app demonstrates some modularity through:

Separation of the Process class
Custom widgets for different UI components
Clear separation of algorithm logic from UI code main.dart:501-586
9. Third-Party Tools & Packages:
url_launcher
Used to open the GitHub repository link from the about page, providing easy access to the source code. main.dart:8

simple_icons
Used in the about page to display the GitHub icon, enhancing the visual appeal of the source code link. about_me.dart:3

10. Advanced Concepts:
Algorithm Visualization
The app provides a real-time visualization of a complex operating system scheduling algorithm, making abstract concepts concrete and interactive. README.md:41-48

Educational Tool Design
The app is designed as an educational tool, with clear visual feedback and interactive elements that help users understand the SRT algorithm. about_me.dart:106-108

11. Biggest Technical Challenges & Solutions:
Real-time Process Scheduling Simulation
Challenge: Implementing a real-time simulation of the SRT algorithm that accurately reflects how processes are scheduled in an operating system.

Solution: Used a timer-based approach to simulate CPU cycles, with the runCycle() method reducing the burst time of the executing process and the adjustPositions() method implementing the SRT algorithm logic. main.dart:145-163

Intuitive Process Creation Interface
Challenge: Creating an intuitive way for users to create processes with different burst times.

Solution: Implemented a long-press gesture on the "Create Process" button, where the duration of the press determines the burst time of the new process, providing a direct and intuitive connection between user action and process attribute. main.dart:417-447

Visual Process Differentiation
Challenge: Making it easy for users to track individual processes through the scheduling lifecycle.

Solution: Assigned a random color to each process and used consistent color coding across all UI components, making it easy to visually identify and track processes. main.dart:437-444

Notes
This comprehensive repo information is based on the SRT Simulator project, which is a Flutter application demonstrating the Shortest Remaining Time scheduling algorithm. The project was developed by Abdul Haseeb in December 2023, as evidenced by the commit dates in the code snippets. The application serves as an educational tool for understanding process scheduling in operating systems, with a focus on visual representation and interactive learning.
