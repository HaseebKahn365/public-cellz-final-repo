What You Learned in the Dart_Language_Practice Repository
Based on the code snippets and wiki pages available, this repository serves as a comprehensive learning resource for Dart programming language fundamentals and advanced concepts. Here's a detailed breakdown of what you learned:

1. Core Dart Language Features
Type System
You explored Dart's static type system, including:

Basic types (int, double, String, bool)
Type inference with var
Explicit typing
Type conversion methods _3buildInTypes.dart:6-11
Variable Declaration
You learned different ways to declare variables:

Using var for type inference
Using explicit types
Using final for single-assignment variables
Using const for compile-time constants late_keyword.dart:36-40
The
late
Keyword
You explored how to use the late keyword for:

Deferred initialization of non-nullable variables
Lazy initialization
Combining with final for single-assignment variables with deferred initialization late_keyword.dart:34-38
Control Flow
You learned various control flow structures:

Conditional statements (if/else, switch/case)
Loops (for, while, do-while)
Exception handling with try/catch/finally _93DartControlFlow.dart:44-55
2. Collections and Data Structures
Lists
You learned how to create and manipulate lists:

Creating lists using literals, constructors, and generators
Adding, accessing, and modifying list elements
Using list methods like add(), sort(), etc. _4lists.dart:10-19
Dot Operators for Collections
You explored special operators for collections:

Cascade operator (..) for performing multiple operations on the same object
Spread operator (...) for inserting elements from one collection into another
Collection if and for for conditional and loop-based collection creation _5dotOperators.dart:12-17
Maps
You learned how to work with key-value pairs using Maps:

Creating maps using literals and constructors
Accessing and modifying map elements
Iterating through maps
Practical applications like calculating averages from nested data structures _5problemMap.dart:34-53
3. Functions and Higher-Order Functions
Function Types
You explored different function types:

Required positional parameters
Optional positional parameters
Required named parameters
Optional named parameters
Hybrid parameter patterns _9dartFunction.dart:50-73
Higher-Order Functions
You learned about functions that take other functions as parameters or return functions:

Passing functions as arguments
Returning functions from functions (closures)
Using anonymous functions (lambdas)
Function type definitions _9OperatorsOnCollection.dart:2-11
Custom Higher-Order Functions
You implemented your own higher-order functions:

A transform<T, R> function that applies a transformation to each element of a list
A custom where<T> function that filters elements based on a condition _9OperatorsOnCollection.dart:23-32
4. Object-Oriented Programming
Classes and Objects
You learned how to define and use classes:

Creating class constructors
Defining instance variables and methods
Using the this keyword FactoryConstructorExercise.dart:1-21
Factory Constructors
You explored factory constructors for creating objects in special ways:

Converting from JSON to objects
Converting objects to JSON FactoryConstructorExercise.dart:6-15
Operator Overloading
You learned how to customize operator behavior for your classes:

Overriding the equality operator (==)
Implementing arithmetic operators like + and *
Using the covariant keyword for type-specific operator parameters _2Equality.dart:13-26
Generics
You explored generic programming for type-safe code:

Creating generic classes with type parameters
Constraining type parameters with bounds
Using generics with collections and functions _98Generics.dart:1-24
5. Asynchronous Programming
Futures
You learned about handling asynchronous operations with Futures:

Creating and using Future objects
Using async and await keywords
Handling Future completion and errors
Streams
You explored working with sequences of asynchronous events:

Creating and consuming streams
Using async* and yield for stream generation
Processing stream data with methods like reduce() _3Stream.dart:1-14
6. Practical Applications
Throughout the repository, you applied these concepts to solve practical problems:

Calculating averages from collections of data
Transforming and filtering data
Creating reusable utility functions
Building simple data models with JSON serialization/deserialization _5problemMap.dart:45-53
Repository Structure
The repository is organized into several main directories:

Dart8hrCourse/: Contains basic to intermediate Dart concepts
Mastering_Dart/: Contains more advanced topics organized by concept:
Collections/: Advanced collection operations
Classes/: Object-oriented programming concepts
AsynchronousProgramming/: Futures, streams, and API usage
This structure allows for progressive learning, starting from core language features and building up to more complex concepts.

Notes:
This repository is primarily focused on learning Dart language features rather than building Flutter applications. It serves as an excellent foundation for understanding the programming language that underlies Flutter development. The examples are concise and focused on demonstrating specific language features rather than building complete applications.
