MagicCalculator

2. GitHub Link:

3. Timeline & Commitment:
August 2023 (Based on git commits from August 4-7, 2023)

4. Project Overview:
MagicCalculator is a fun Flutter application inspired by a YouTube magician's trick. It appears to be a regular calculator but has a magical twist - no matter what calculations users perform, the result always equals a secretly pre-selected phone number from their contacts!

The target audience is anyone who enjoys magic tricks and wants to surprise their friends with a seemingly impossible mathematical trick.

5. Core Functionality:
The app consists of two key components:
- A calculator interface that looks completely normal
- A hidden contact selector that sets up the "magic" trick

The trick works by letting the presenter secretly select a contact's phone number, after which any calculations performed will magically result in that number, creating an illusion of mathematical wizardry.

6. Key Features:
- Deceptively normal calculator interface
- Secret contact number selection through long-press of "!" button
- Magical result manipulation (always shows the pre-selected phone number)
- Convincing calculator animations and operations

7. Flutter/Dart Skills Demonstrated:
- UI design making the calculator look authentic
- State management to maintain the illusion
- Contact integration for the magic trick setup

8. Technical Implementation:
The magic happens through:
- Background number manipulation
- Stored contact number as the forced result
- Authentic-looking calculator operations that are actually staged

9. Inspiration:
Inspired by classic magician's props where seemingly random calculations always lead to a predetermined number. Modernized for the digital age by incorporating phone contacts as the "forced" number.

10. Usage:
1. Presenter secretly long-presses "!" to select a contact
2. Hands device to audience
3. Let them perform any calculations
4. Watch their amazement when results always match the chosen phone number

Note: This app was created purely for entertainment purposes as a digital magic trick.
