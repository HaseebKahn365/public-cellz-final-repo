1. Repo Name:
Data-Structures-CW (Data Structures Coursework)

2. GitHub Link:
https://github.com/HaseebKahn365/Data-Structures-CW

3. Timeline & Commitment:
Based on the git commit timestamps in the provided snippets, the project appears to have been active from approximately December 2023 to January 2024. The earliest commit shown is from December 15, 2023, and the latest is from January 3, 2024.

4. Project Overview:
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms implementations in C++. It serves as both a practical toolkit and educational resource, covering essential computer science concepts from basic data structures to more complex application systems. The project focuses on core data structures like trees, hash tables, and linked lists, while also demonstrating their application in real-world scenarios such as encryption, smart home systems, and process scheduling.

The target audience appears to be computer science students or educators looking for practical implementations of data structures and algorithms concepts. The repository seems to be organized as coursework or educational material.

5. Core Functionality:
The repository is organized into several main systems:

Core Data Structures:

Binary Search Trees (BST) with various implementations
AVL Trees (Self-Balancing BST)
Hash Tables with different collision resolution strategies
Linked Lists
Application Systems:

Encryption/Compression System: A hybrid system that selects between Alpha Substitution Cipher and Huffman Coding based on message length
Smart Home Simulation: Demonstrates application of data structures in managing home devices and user preferences
Process Scheduling: Implementations of various OS scheduling algorithms
The repository demonstrates how these data structures communicate and work together in practical applications. For example, the Smart Home system uses linked lists to manage persons and binary search trees to store user preferences.

6. Key Features:
Binary Search Trees Implementation
Includes specialized versions like AirplaneTree for scheduling
Implements various tree operations including insertion, deletion, and traversal
Demonstrates different node deletion strategies (leaf node, one child, two children)
Hash Tables with Multiple Collision Resolution Strategies
Implements linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing
Provides dynamic resizing based on load factor monitoring
Used in encryption components
Hybrid Encryption/Compression System
Automatically selects between Alpha Substitution Cipher (for shorter messages) and Huffman Coding (for longer messages)
The Alpha Substitution Cipher implements a simple character substitution encryption
Huffman Coding provides data compression by encoding characters based on frequency
Smart Home Simulation
Uses linked lists to manage persons (HPerson objects)
Employs binary search trees to store and retrieve user preferences
Includes various device classes to represent smart home components
Process Scheduling Algorithms
Implements various scheduling algorithms like Round Robin
Demonstrates queue-based implementation for process management
7. C++ Skills Demonstrated:
Instead of Flutter/Dart skills (as this is a C++ project), here are the C++ skills demonstrated:

Object-Oriented Programming: Extensive use of classes and inheritance
Data Structures: Implementation of trees, linked lists, hash tables
Algorithms: Tree traversal, encryption, compression, scheduling
Memory Management: Dynamic allocation and deallocation
Standard Template Library (STL): Usage of containers like vectors, queues, and maps
8. Architecture & Design Decisions:
The repository follows an object-oriented design with clear separation of concerns:

Each data structure is implemented as its own class with well-defined interfaces
Application systems are built on top of these core data structures
The code is modular with different components handling specific responsibilities
The folder structure appears to be organized by assignments or topics, with each folder containing related implementations.

9. Third-Party Tools & Libraries:
The code primarily uses standard C++ libraries:

<iostream> for input/output operations
<string> for string manipulation
<queue> and <vector> for STL containers
<chrono> for timing operations
10. Advanced Concepts:
Self-Balancing Trees: Implementation of AVL trees with rotation operations
Huffman Coding: Advanced compression algorithm using frequency analysis and variable-length codes
Simulation Systems: Smart home simulation demonstrating real-world application of data structures
11. Biggest Technical Challenges & Solutions:
Based on the code complexity, some likely challenges were:

Implementing Tree Balancing in AVL Trees
Solution: Careful implementation of rotation operations and balance factor calculations
The code shows detailed implementation of left and right rotations to maintain tree balance
Efficient Compression with Huffman Coding
Solution: Building frequency tables and constructing optimal Huffman trees
The implementation shows careful bit manipulation for efficient storage
Integrating Multiple Data Structures in Application Systems
Solution: Clear interfaces between components and thoughtful system design
The Smart Home system demonstrates how different data structures can work together
12. Role in the Project:
Based on the git blame information, Abdul Haseeb appears to be the primary (or sole) contributor to this repository, implementing all the data structures and application systems shown in the snippets.

Notes
This template has been filled out based on the available code snippets and wiki pages from the HaseebKahn365/Data-Structures-CW repository. The repository appears to be a collection of data structures and algorithms implementations in C++, likely created as coursework or educational material. The information about timeline is based on git commit timestamps in the provided snippets, which show activity from December 2023 to January 2024.

Since this is a C++ project focused on data structures and algorithms rather than a Flutter/Dart application, I've adapted section 7 to highlight C++ skills instead of Flutter/Dart skills as requested in the original template.
