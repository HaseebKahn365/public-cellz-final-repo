Repo Name:
works_out

GitHub Link (optional):

Duration/Timeline:
July 2023 - August 2023 (based on commit timestamps from July 25, 2023 to August 14, 2023)

Project Description (2â€“5 lines):
WorksOut is a Flutter-based workout tracking application that allows users to record and visualize their workout data. It enables tracking of push-ups, pull-ups, and custom workouts, providing statistical visualization of progress over time. The app is designed for fitness enthusiasts who want to monitor their exercise routines.

Key Features Implemented:

User authentication system with Firebase Auth and Google Sign-in
Workout tracking for push-ups and pull-ups with cloud synchronization
Custom workout creation and tracking with local storage
Statistical visualization with charts (line charts, pie charts, radial progress)
Daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly workout records and statistics
Responsive UI that adapts to different screen sizes
Light/dark theme support with customizable color schemes
Flutter/Dart Skills Demonstrated:

State management using StatefulWidget
FlutterFire integration (Firebase Auth, Firestore, Storage)
Custom widgets development (charts, progress indicators)
Local data persistence
Responsive design implementation
Cross-platform development
Asynchronous programming with Futures
Tools & Packages Used: pubspec.yaml:30-52

Key packages include:

firebase_core, firebase_auth, cloud_firestore, firebase_storage
google_sign_in
fl_chart (for data visualization)
image_picker, image_cropper
path_provider (for local storage)
shared_preferences (for theme persistence)
intl (for date formatting)
Design Pattern or Architecture Used:
The application follows a modular architecture pattern with distinct systems responsible for different aspects of functionality: main.dart:24-31

The architecture is organized into four primary subsystems:

Authentication System
Workout Tracking System
Statistics Visualization System
Custom Workouts System
Each subsystem has clear responsibilities and interfaces with other parts of the application.

Challenges Solved / Highlights:

Implemented a dual storage system that uses Firebase for push-ups/pull-ups and local storage for custom workouts
Created a sophisticated data visualization system with multiple chart types
Developed a responsive UI that adapts between bottom navigation and side navigation based on screen width
Built a comprehensive workout tracking system that maintains daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly statistics
Implemented a theme management system with persistent user preferences
Designed a data structure in Firestore that efficiently stores and retrieves workout history firebase_uploader.dart:114-140 firebase_uploader.dart:363-387
Notes
The repository appears to be a personal workout tracking application developed in Flutter with Firebase integration. The architecture is well-documented in the wiki, showing a modular approach with clear separation of concerns. The timeline was determined from git commit dates, showing development primarily in July-August 2023. The app demonstrates several Flutter skills including Firebase integration, custom widgets, and responsive design.
