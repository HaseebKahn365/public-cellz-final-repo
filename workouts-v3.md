Comprehensive Repo Information for Workouts_V3
1. Repo Name:
Workouts_V3

2. GitHub Link:
https://github.com/HaseebKahn365/workouts_v3

3. Timeline & Commitment:
November 2023 - June 2024 (based on commit dates from the codebase) main.dart:3-5

4. Project Overview:
Workouts_V3 is a Flutter application designed to track various types of activities and workouts. The app allows users to create, monitor, and analyze both count-based and time-based activities. It provides visualization tools to track progress over time through charts and statistics.

The target audience is individuals who want to track their daily activities, workouts, or habits with detailed record-keeping and progress visualization.

The core goals of the app are to help users track activity completion, visualize progress over time, predict the likelihood of completing activities based on historical patterns, and export activity data for further analysis. today_screen.dart:1-8

5. Core Functionality:
Screens/Pages and Flow:
The app has three main screens accessible via a bottom navigation bar (on mobile) or navigation rail (on wider screens):

Home Screen: For creating and managing activities
Today Screen: Shows today's progress and completion probabilities
Overall Screen: Displays weekly progress charts and allows data export main.dart:90-102
Business Logic Layers:
The app uses a Parent class as the main data container, which holds a list of Activity objects. Each Activity contains dated records, image maps, and tag maps. The business logic includes probability calculations for activity completion and data processing for visualization. overall_screen.dart:254-266

Communication Between Modules:
The app uses Riverpod for state management, allowing different screens to access and modify the shared Parent object. Changes to activities trigger UI updates across the app. main.dart:15

Real-time or Offline Behavior:
The app supports both online and offline functionality. It uses Firebase for cloud storage and synchronization but also maintains local data persistence through SQLite and SharedPreferences. sql_services.dart:164-177

User Data Handling:
CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete activities
Sync: Data is synchronized with Firebase Firestore
Local Storage: Uses SQLite for structured data and SharedPreferences for app settings
Media Storage: Images are stored in Firebase Storage with local caching sql_services.dart:179-189
Error, State, Navigation, and Animation Management:
State Management: Uses Riverpod for reactive state management
Navigation: Implements custom navigation with bottom navigation bar and navigation rail
Animations: Uses flutter_animate package for UI animations
Error Handling: Implements try-catch blocks for database and network operations today_screen.dart:3
6. Key Features:
Activity Tracking
Users can create and track two types of activities: count-based (measured in repetitions) and time-based (measured in minutes). The app maintains a history of all activity records with timestamps. home_screen.dart:51-60

Progress Visualization
The app provides multiple visualization methods:

Progress bars comparing today's activity to personal bests
Pie charts for time-based and count-based activities
Line charts showing weekly progress today_screen.dart:250-270
Probability Calculation
A distinctive feature that predicts the likelihood of completing activities based on historical patterns, using probability formulas and past data from the same hour of day. today_screen.dart:5-6

Data Export
Allows exporting activity records to CSV format for external analysis, particularly useful in the web version of the application. overall_screen.dart:454-474

Media Attachment
Users can attach images to activity records, which are stored in Firebase Storage and displayed in the activity details screen. activity_screen.dart:11

Tagging System
Activities can be tagged for better organization and filtering. activity_screen.dart:96-98

7. Flutter/Dart Skills Demonstrated:
State Management
Uses Riverpod for state management, creating a centralized Parent provider that holds all activities and their states. This allows for reactive UI updates when data changes. main.dart:15

Routing
Implements custom navigation using a combination of bottom navigation bar for mobile and navigation rail for larger screens, with conditional rendering based on screen width. main.dart:853-887

Forms and Validation
Implements form validation for activity creation and record entry, including input formatters for numeric fields. activity_screen.dart:175-179

Async Programming & Future/Stream Use
Extensively uses async/await for database operations, Firebase interactions, and file operations. Implements Future-based data loading and processing. sql_services.dart:148-162

Custom Widgets
Creates reusable widgets for charts, progress indicators, and activity cards. Implements complex UI components like expandable tiles and data tables. overall_screen.dart:435-453

8. Architecture & Design Decisions:
Architecture Pattern
The app follows a modified MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern:

Model: Activity and related data classes
View: Screen widgets (HomeScreen, Today, Overall)
ViewModel: Parent class with Riverpod for state management overall_screen.dart:254-266
Folder Structure and Separation of Concerns
lib/: Main application code
lib/buisiness_logic/: Business logic classes and utilities
lib/screens/: UI screens and components
assets/: Static assets like images db_table_view.dart:1-16
Testability and Modularity
The app demonstrates modularity through separation of concerns, with distinct classes for different responsibilities. The use of dependency injection via Riverpod enhances testability. main.dart:21-24

9. Third-Party Tools & Packages:

10. Advanced Concepts:
Cross-Platform Support
The app is designed to work on both mobile and web platforms, with responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. main.dart:68-70

Offline Support
Implements local database storage using SQLite to enable offline functionality, with synchronization to Firebase when online. sql_services.dart:121-139

11. Biggest Technical Challenges & Solutions:
Data Synchronization
Challenge: Maintaining data consistency between local storage and Firebase.
Solution: Implemented a robust synchronization system with SQLite as local storage and Firebase as the cloud backend, with conflict resolution strategies. sql_services.dart:164-205

Cross-Platform UI
Challenge: Creating a responsive UI that works well on both mobile and web platforms.
Solution: Used conditional rendering based on screen width to provide different navigation experiences (bottom bar vs. rail) and layout adjustments. main.dart:853-887

Performance Optimization
Challenge: Handling large datasets efficiently, especially for chart rendering.
Solution: Implemented data processing methods to aggregate and prepare data for visualization, reducing the computational load during rendering. overall_screen.dart:46-60
